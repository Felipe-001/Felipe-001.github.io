## CPSC 120

* Lab 2

    Lab 5 Part-2 was one of my favorites because of the amount of pride and sense of fulfillment I felt when I completed it. That lab was the beginning of many in which my partner and I struggled to get the code to run properly. We poured so much effort in trying to make sure that the equations and the if states worked properly and when they did we were overjoyed. This lab holds a special place in my heart because it is what influenced me to keep coding and keep pushing myself even if I didn't know what I was doing. It also taught me how to properly write equations in code and how to use the if ; else loop, something that I struggled with at first.


* Lab 4

    Lab 4 Part-2 was a favorite of mine because of how much we had to think about how to convert the units of measure into a different type. This led to us writing a lot of different types of code and if statements to ensure that the measurements that were input were converted to the proper units. Furthermore I found it extremely fun trying to troubleshoot this code, especially since we were using a new type of truncating code for decimals. It taught me how to initialize float variables, the importance of initializing variables before trying to write equations using them, and how to truncate decimals in code.


* Lab 6

    By far one of my most favorite labs was Lab 6 Part-2 because it involved us creating a little mini game. I felt really invested in this lab and I was genuinely excited to put the time and effort into making this game. In addition to this I really enjoyed figuring out what body-statements we should use for the while ; if loops to ensure that the code runs smoothly. For example making it so that if the user's guess is lower or higher than the secret number then it prompts the computer to say "Enter Another Number:".  Some of the things I learned from this lab is how to utilize the while loop and if statements to prompt different outputs for the computer. For example in this lab if the user inputs the correct number then the program outputs "You Won!" otherwise it says "Enter Another Number".
