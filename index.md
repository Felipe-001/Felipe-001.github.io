* Lab 2

    Lab 5 Part-2 was one of my favorites because of the amount of pride and sense of fulfillment I felt when I completed it. That lab was the beginning of many in which my partner and I struggled to get the code to run properly. We poured so much effort in trying to make sure that the equations and the if states worked properly and when they did we were overjoyed. This lab holds a special place in my heart because it is what influenced me to keep coding and keep pushing myself even if I didn't know what I was doing. It also taught me how to properly write equations in code and how to use the if ; else loop, something that I struggled with at first.
